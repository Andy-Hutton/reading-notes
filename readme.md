## What is this website?

This is my reading notes for the full stack bootcamp where I will become a wizzard at code... hopefully.
This page will give me an opportunity to test my new skills out and demonstrate what I have learnt.

## What is [growth mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)?

1. embrace- the challange
2. persist- with the problem
3. learn- from the training examples, available reading material and your peers

Growth mindset is having the ability to persist when I am learning something new, understanding that I cant do it yet.
My son 👨‍🦽 is the perfect example of this.

Theo is 5 years old and has quad CP he is a full time wheelchair user.  
Although he is non verbal he can use a computer called an eyegaze to communicate. Imagine it as an eye pad for your eyes, when he looks at a tile it will add the word/ letter to a sentence. He can look at 'read' and it will read the sentence out aloud for us all to hear! He likes to ask our google speaker to tell him jokes and he enjoys calling his teacher "a cheeky monkey"!
