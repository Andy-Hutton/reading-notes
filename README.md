## What is this website?

This is my reading notes for the full stack bootcamp where I will become a wizzard at code... hopefully.

## What is [growth mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)?

1. embrace
2. persist
3. learn

Growth mindset is having the ability to persist when I am learning something new, understanding that I cant do it yet.
My son 👨‍🦽 is the perfect example of this.

 is 5 years old and has quad CP he is a full time wheelchair user. Although he is non verbal he can use a computer called an eyegaze to communicate.
Imagine it as an eye pad for your eyes, when he looks at a tile it will add the word/ letter to a sentence. He can look at 'read' and it will read the sentence out aloud for us all to hear!
