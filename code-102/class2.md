New notes from this afternoons learning
## What we learnt  
* Getting your computer installed with the latest software is somewhat time consuming
* Patience and the ability to learn is the key to completing the task
* we covered basic syntax, adding links and pictures  

## Putting it into practice
We created a page using github, it uses MD and is used best when the page only has content, not when you are trying to gather information.
